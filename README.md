ECMAScript modules and bundling
-------------------------------

To run the examples, you'll need a browser that supports modules:

- Safari 10.1 or later

- Chrome Canary 60:
  Look for the "Experimental Web Platform" flag in `chrome:flags`

- Microsoft Edge: look for "Experimental JavaScript Features" in `about:flags`

- Firefox 54: set `dom.moduleScripts.enabled` to `true` in `about:config`

**You'll also need to run a local http server to serve the files**

If you want to run and change the code you'll also need

  - Node.js
